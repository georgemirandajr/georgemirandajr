**How to Read Books**

Put myself in the author's perspective.
Write summaries with my own metaphors or interpretations.  

I can write a summary for each book of these books:
1. A Short History of U.S. History
2. Bitter Fruit
3. John Locke's thoughts on knowledge
4. Philosophy 101
5. Ethics 101
6. On Liberty by John Stuart Mills

**Capture Information (Take Notes)**
Copy/past and highlight text with formatting (highlights, bold, underline)

**Create Folders for Each Project**
App Ideas, capturing summaries, video tutorials, etc.
