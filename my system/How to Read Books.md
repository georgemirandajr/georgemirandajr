**How to Read Books**

Put myself in the author's perspective.
Write summaries with my own metaphors or interpretations.  

I can write a summary for each book of these books:
1. A Short History of U.S. History
2. Bitter Fruit
3. John Locke's thoughts on knowledge
4. Philosophy 101
5. Ethics 101
6. On Liberty by John Stuart Mills
