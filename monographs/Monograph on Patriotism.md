What is #patriotism?

Admiration for the flag of one's country.  Admiration for the society one belongs to.  Appreciation for the people that provided the current conditions of the government and society.  Some may believe that patriotism is the kind of unconditional love only a mother can give to a child with a face only a mother can love.  In other words, to love one's government and society in spite of its flaws.  Some might go as far as honoring the soil and air that finds itself within the borders of the country.

John Stuart Mill discusses #government and the contract between the individual and society and various forms of government.  There is a contrast between self-government and tyrannical government.  He speaks of the majority in a distrustful way.  He says, "The will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will of the most numerous part or the most active part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power." 

Mill profoundly suggests that although the tyranny of the majority is often defended against when it operates though public authorities, there is a much greater threat that must be defended when this tyranny operates through society.  Collectively, individuals who form a majority of opinion and power, may oppress the minority through public ridicule and cultural norms.  Mill argues that this type of tyranny can have more severe effects because it is harder to escape and can "enslave the soul itself".  What makes this topic more pressing is the current trend of inserting politics into all facets of daily life.  From morning to night, politics can and will take centerstage.

3. Career choices can be influenced by leadership politics (who you choose to work for) and career choices can influence politics (you want to see your company survive)  
4. Where you live is informed by political preferences and vice versa
5. What sports, movies, actors, and musicians you watch, news you see, and social media platforms you use.
