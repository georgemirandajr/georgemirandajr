There is a clear distinction between discourse of politics and that of political issues.  Politics, as we know it today, is theater.  A discussion about politics involves defending your favorite character as a hero and attacking their adversary as a villain.  It's always black and white; us against them.  A sense of identity is established when discussing politics in this way.  The goal of this type of conversation is to vent one's anger, make another person feel dumb or at least wrong.  If you are genuinely inquisitive about the experiences of others and desire knowledge of truth, then political discourse is not for you.
