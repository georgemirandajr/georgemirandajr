What is Art?
That's the same as asking what is beauty?
Beauty is art and vice versa.  Beauty in this case does not always refer to formal qualities of an art form, such as color, lines, texture, size, etc.  Beauty can refer to meaning.  In these cases, that meaning may be knowledge or wisdom.  Even depictions of war and the grotesque can be beautiful because of the meaning it conveys to the viewer.  That conveyed meaning then invigorates some emotion and that is the beauty I am referring to.

So is it art if a painting looks to be done without the skill of a paintbrush or understanding of anatomy or architecture?  Is it art if it is drawn as perfectly as if it were a photograph?  Is a photograph art if it appears to be taken without skill or knowledge of photography principles?  Is it art if an artist produces it?  Is it art if a non-artist produces it?

These questions have been answered by the likes of Magritte, Duchamp, Man Ray, Warhol, Basquiat, and several others.
