Designing a Hybrid Workspace 
1. Determine the key jobs and tasks
2. Determine the performance drivers of these jobs and tasks
3. Engage employees with surveys, developing personas, and interviews
4. Streamline processes to reduce redundancy and work arounds
5. Train managers on how to manage hybrid teams
6. Invest in tools that enable coordination

Overall, the goal is to take an employee-centered approach that also supports the needs of the organization.  This will ultimately help the organization achieve more and be more desirable to a larger talent pool. 

Question: The approach appears to be focused on the change management aspect of designing a hybrid workspace.  Would an organization maintain an successful hybrid workplace by simply repeating these steps at regular intervals or are there other considerations?
