Wanting to solidify and share my unique experience working with software development, I want to create concise videos on a single topic.  

**Videos**
1. [ ] Everything you need to know to start working in R (packages, data structures, loops, functions, executing scripts)
2. [X] R Studio code snippets (data.table example, read_fwf)
3. [X] Quickly setup custom project folders (data, output, utils, www)
4. [X] R Addins as a package + see Snippets
5. Publish Addins on Github
6. Setting up API connections in R
7. Publishing a static R app on SharePoint w/ RMD
8. Using MS Teams folders with R - sync, read, write
9. Using Airtable in R (airtabler)
10. Sending gorgeous emails with R
11. A better shiny template w/ modules and css templates
12. Sending gorgeous emails with R
13. Sending text messages with R
14. Tictoc()
15. Purrr
16. Furrr 
17. Emails with Power Automate
18. NQL with R (Ask Ada)

**Description of the Video Series**
Make your life a little easier with R.  Hacks are temporary, these videos offer solutions that'll stick like glue.

**Ideas for Titles**
Something that fits the idea of **snippets** (quick inserts of templates), components, modules, placeholder. I'm thinking of those dishes with the 3 containers.  There's one for the main dish and 2 sides.  That's a template for your dinner.
Or something like Data Wranglin', Data Rodeo, or Data Lasso.. I like the cowboy theme.  Wrangler jeans and lasso.
