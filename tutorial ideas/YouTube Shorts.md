Wanting to solidify and share my unique experience working with software development, I want to create concise videos on a single topic.  

**Videos**
1. R Studio code snippets (data.table example, read_fwf)
2. Quickly setup custom project folders (data, output, utils, www)
3. R Addins as a package + see Snippets
4. Publish Addins on Github
5. Setting up API connections in R
6. Publishing a static R app on SharePoint w/ RMD
7. Using MS Teams folders with R - sync, read, write
8. Using Airtable in R (airtabler)
9. Sending gorgeous emails with R
10. A better shiny template w/ modules and css templates
11. Sending gorgeous emails with R
12. Sending text messages with R
13. Tictoc()
14. Purrr
15. Furrr 
16. Emails with Power Automate
17. NQL with R (Ask Ada)

**Description of the Video Series**
Make your life a little easier with R.  Hacks are temporary, these videos offer solutions that'll stick like glue.

**Ideas for Titles**
Something that fits the idea of **snippets** (quick inserts of templates), components, modules, placeholder. I'm thinking of those dishes with the 3 containers.  There's one for the main dish and 2 sides.  That's a template for your dinner.
Or something like Data Wranglin', Data Rodeo, or Data Lasso.. I like the cowboy theme.  Wrangler jeans and lasso.
