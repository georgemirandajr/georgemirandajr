A website to match up people based on #political preferences 

**Goals**
1. Connect you with people who share your opinion on specific policy matters and issues.
2. Connect you with people who disagree with you and help you build constructive conversation

**Steps**
Identify categories of issues and specific stances for each. Each stance is essentially a solution or approach to each issue.  They should be quick responses like Google reviews cards.  You can skip or swipe to move to the next one.  And add checkpoints every 5 or 10 questions to keep them motivated.
