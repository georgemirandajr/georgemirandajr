Fantastic for repetitive or hard-to-remember chunks of code.  R Studio code snippets give you the ability to quickly repurpose your code as templates.
I use snippets for building get requests, grouping and summarizing data with dplyr, inserting custom functions, and much more.

Go to Tools > Global Options > Code.
Check the box under the *Snippets* section.  This enables code snippets in R Studio.
Go to Edit Snippets to create and modify code snippets.

You'll notice that there's already tons of snippets for each type of file.  My most common file types are R files (of course), Markdown, and HTML. 

I'm going to show you how to create a snippet for a custom function called createProject, which takes a directory path and string field to name your new project.

Start by using the snippet keyword followed by the name of your snippet. When you're writing a script and type this name, you'll see this snippet suggested to you. 
Hit enter and write the code that you want to appear when you select this snippet.  
snippet createProject
	createProject(path = choose.dir(), ${1:name})
