## R Studio Addins Changed My Life

Want to take your coding efficiency into hyper-drive?  R Add-Ins will do that!  The power of addins really hit me when I started writing my own for the team that I work with.  By packaging my code as addins, my team can now take advantage of the tools I've built that make the job more efficient.  

## What is an R Studio Addin?

This seldomly discussed, yet powerful feature of R Studio allows you take advantage of extensions written for R by simply clicking "Addins" and choosing from a list of installed addins.

## Examples

There are tons of addin examples
- [esquisse](https://www.dreamrs.fr/) to quickly visualize your data and save the code to reproduce it
- [questionr](https://juba.github.io/questionr/) to do survey analysis
- [ViewPipeSteps](https://github.com/daranzolin/ViewPipeSteps) to understand the output of each step in a dplyr workflow (also helps debugging)

## Build Your Own

You can create an addin as simple or as complex as you want.
